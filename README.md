## Introduction
My name is Nathan and I’m in 10th grade this year. One thing I really enjoy is listening to music because it helps me relax and focus. I usually put on music when I’m doing homework or just hanging out, and it always makes the day better. It gives me energy when I need it and keeps me in a good mood. This year I’m looking forward to learning new things and pushing myself to do better.

My favorite movie is Spider-Man: No Way Home because it mixes action, comedy, and emotional moments all in one. I liked when all three Spider-Men showed up because it was such a big surprise and made the story even more exciting. The movie also shows that heroes sometimes have to make tough sacrifices, which made it feel really meaningful. At the same time, it had funny parts that kept it entertaining. It’s one of those movies I can watch over and over and still enjoy.

I also spend a lot of time playing basketball. Most of the time I play with friends at the park, and it’s always fun because it keeps me active while also giving us something to do together. Basketball has taught me a lot about teamwork since you have to talk and work with others to play well. I’ve been practicing my jump shot and dribbling to get better, and I can already see some improvement. Playing a few times a week keeps me motivated and gives me something to look forward to outside of school.
